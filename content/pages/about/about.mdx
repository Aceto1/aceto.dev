Hi, I'm Lucas.

I'm a 22 year-old software developer living in Jena, Germany.

I'm currently working as a fullstack developer at a medium-sized company in Erfurt.

In my daily work I mostly use TypeScript + React for any frontend development (of which I've grown fond of recently) and .Net Core for backend related things. I also have worked with WPF in the past and did my share of database-level (SQL) development.

You can learn more about my skills and background in my CV (coming to this website soonâ„¢).

You can contact me [here](mailto:lucas@aceto.dev).
